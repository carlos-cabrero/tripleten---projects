# Basic Python

# Project Description

At this point, you should be familiar with **different types of data**, including basic ones like int, float, and bool, as well as more complex types like strings and lists. You’ve also learned how to convert one data type to another and perform arithmetic operations with numeric values.

Error handling is no longer an issue because you can easily implement the try-except block to avoid crashes.

String formatting becomes more convenient with the format() method or with f-strings. Additionally, you can easily change the case of any string using the upper() or lower() methods. If there are unnecessary spaces, the strip() method can remove them. Finally, you can now replace part of a string using the replace() method.

Lists are an excellent way to store a collection of values within a single data structure. List elements can be sliced by passing the desired indices into brackets.

Loops can save us a lot of time. You now know how to iterate over elements in a list using a for loop. On the other hand, the while loop is useful when we want to continue iterating until a particular condition is met.

Using conditional statements to create branches in your code.

With that in mind, let’s move on to the project where you can practice the skills and knowledge you’ve just acquired.

# Instructions for Completing the Project

You are provided with a template notebook where you can write your code. To complete the project, fill in all the code cells in the template.

Before starting, let’s go over the project stages:

- `Stage 1`: Read the project. The notebook already has cells with instructions on what type of code to write, so it’s a good idea to read through all the tasks and get an overview of what you’ll be doing.

- `Stage 2`: Solve. In this stage, you will solve each task by writing your own code in the appropriate code cell. Don’t forget to write comments in your code to make the review process easier and faster.

- `Stage 3`: Review. Go back and review the coding steps to ensure everything is resolved, the code is well-written, and properly commented. Add anything you think might be useful before submitting your project for review.
