# Unsupervised Learning


## Description

**Course on Unsupervised Learning**

You learned how to:

- Use the k-means algorithm to group data effectively.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters and visualize the resulting groups for better insights.
- Detect anomalies in both one-dimensional and multidimensional data, enhancing your ability to identify outliers and irregular patterns.

## Data Overview

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on data without predefined labels, allowing it to identify patterns, relationships, and structures on its own. The skills you acquired, such as using the k-means algorithm and detecting anomalies, are crucial for tasks like customer segmentation, anomaly detection in cybersecurity, and data exploration in various fields. These techniques enable you to uncover hidden insights in datasets, optimize processes, and make data-driven decisions without prior knowledge of the categories or patterns in the data.
